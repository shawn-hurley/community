# 2018 Kubernetes Contributor Summit US

This event brings together new and current Kubernetes contributors to connect and share face-to-face. It is an opportunity for existing contributors to help shape the future of community development and offers a welcoming space for new community members to learn, explore and put the contributor workflow to practice.
The summit now spans two days; including an optional social event in the early evening of December 9th along with the main full-day event December 10th.

In some sense, the summit is a real-life extension of the community meetings and SIG meetings. There are three explicit goals:

- Cross-SIG communication and announcements
- Onboard new contributors to be productive in our community
- Send contributors home with more context, knowledge, and skills about the project

## Registration

Public registration for the event is now closed. If you are a SIG/WG Chair, Tech Lead, or Subproject Owner, please reach out to community@kubernetes.io to make arrangements. There is a limited amount of reserved slots available to you.

### Proposing a BoF Session

We have 4 slots available for the unconference section of the summit.
Submit your talk idea on a 5x8 index card provided at The Garage during the Sunday event
and in room 610 during the day of the Summit.

#### Proposers:
- Hang your card on the board in Room 610
- You are encouraged to advertise your session to garner support.
- These sessions are working sessions, they are NOT 1 hour venting sessions, 
by proposing a talk you are committing to gathering work items and proposals, 
and coming up with _actionable items_ that people can work on for the next development cycle.

#### Attendees:
You are encouraged to check the board for sessions that interest you and VOTE on them
by putting a dot (and only one dot!) on the session that you would be interested in participating in.

- Please respect the process by only voting for sessions you plan on attending and refraining from gaming the system.  
- Prior to lunch during the Summit we will pick and announce the top 4 talks by number of votes and then 
schedule them for the afternoon.

In case of a tie or unclear winner we will schedule the sessions in the contributor lounge.
